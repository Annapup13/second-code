    <h3>Structure of HTML</h3>
    <h2>DOCTYPE first</h2>
    <h2>Then the html tag <br>
    <br>Head tag comes next</h2>
    <h4>Inside the head tag is where information about the website is stored.<br>
        Users don't see this information. (except the title!)
    </h4>
    <h2>Finally, we have the body tag</h2>
    <h4>This is where we make our website!<br>
    <br>Anything in our website should be <em>INSIDE</em> the body tags</h4>
    <h2>There is only ONE opening and body tag, and ONE closing body tag</h2>
